# Norwegian Variant, (Original)
````
Oh dontcha know, the stars are brightly shining  (O holy night the stars are brightly shining)
It is the night of the singing christmas tree    (It is the night of our dear Savior's birth)
Short are the days and kids are outside sledding (Long lay the world in sin and error pining)
And ice rinks froze and children sang with glee (Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth)<-- Needs work
... To be continued.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine o night
O night divine
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine o night
O night divine
Ooh yes it was
Ooh it is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
It was a holy holy holy, oh oh oh
